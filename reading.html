            I am writing to inform you of some important changes to our office procedures, which will take effect on November 1. These changes are aimed at improving overall efficiency and ensuring a safer working environment for everyone.<br><br>
            1. Visitor Check-in Process: Starting in November, all visitors must check in at the front desk upon arrival. They will be required to sign in and wear a visitor's badge throughout their stay. Please ensure that all visitors are directed to the reception area immediately upon arrival.<br><br>
            2. Security Access Cards: To enhance security, each employee will be issued a personalized access card. These cards are to be used to enter the building and access restricted areas such as the server room and storage facilities. Please note that cards are non-transferable and must be reported immediately if lost or stolen.<br><br>
            3. Conference Room Reservations: Effective immediately, all conference rooms must be booked through the new online reservation system. This will help to avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure that the rooms are available when needed. Instructions on how to use the system will be sent out in a separate email.<br><br>
            We believe that these changes will streamline operations and make the office a more secure place to work. If you have any questions regarding the new procedures, feel free to contact the administration office.<br><br>

            Dear Customer Service,<br><br>
            I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent purchase I made from your online store. On January 20, I placed an order for a set of wireless headphones (Order #77356), which I received on January 27. Unfortunately, the product I received was not as advertised on your website.<br><br>
            First, the headphones arrived in damaged packaging, and the left earphone does not work at all. Additionally, the product description on your website stated that the headphones would come with a charging cable, but no such cable was included in the box. I believe I should receive either a full refund or a replacement product that meets the advertised specifications.<br><br>
            I have attempted to contact your customer service department multiple times via phone and email, but I have yet to receive a response. This level of service is unacceptable, especially for a company that prides itself on customer satisfaction. I would appreciate it if this matter could be resolved as soon as possible.<br><br>
            Please advise on how you plan to handle this situation. I would prefer to resolve this issue without taking further steps, but I will if necessary.<br><br>

            I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Rihanna Jung for the position of Marketing Manager at your company. I have had the pleasure of working with Rihanna for the past four years at Westbrook Solutions, where she has consistently demonstrated exceptional skills and dedication in her role as Senior Marketing Specialist.<br><br>
            
            Throughout her time at Westbrook, Rihanna has shown outstanding leadership abilities, particularly during the launch of several high-profile campaigns. She played a key role in increasing our client base by 30% in just two years, which significantly contributed to the company's growth. Her ability to manage multiple projects while maintaining high standards of quality is truly impressive.<br><br>
            
            Rihanna is not only a talented marketer but also a natural leader. She was responsible for training and mentoring new team members, and her supportive and collaborative approach helped improve overall team performance. She is highly organized, reliable, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure the success of her team and the company.<br><br>
            
            In conclusion, I have no doubt that Rihanna will be an asset to your organization. Her combination of skills, experience, and leadership make her an ideal candidate for the position of Marketing Manager. If you have any further questions about Rihanna's qualifications, feel free to contact me at (566) 176-3451 or via email at j.van@westbrook.com.<br><br>
